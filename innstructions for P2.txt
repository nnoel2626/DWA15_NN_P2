Background and Instructions
The xkcd Password Generator is design to people not only create a very strong password but also as memory aid by using those cartoon characters. I use the same principal to create my XKCD Password Generator. I used good old and memorable American to generate my password and strengthen by a randomized series of numbers and symbols. I also capitalized every first letter of the proverb string.
xkcd Password Generator features:
o	Default Word Count: The default number of words is four and it goes up to 12 words per password.
o	ADD CAPITAL: Add a capital letter: If on, the first letter of the password will be capitalized. Default is off.
o	ADD NUMBERS. Add a number: Numbers between (1-9) will be randomly added to the end of the proverb
o	ADD SYMBOLS:  Add special character ( .-+=_,!@$#) symbols will be added to the end of the password. 
o	PRESERVING USER INPUTS: Inputs selection will be preserved after form have been reset
o	Generator button will reset and generate a new password each time it is pressed.
